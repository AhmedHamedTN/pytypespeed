VERSION .1a

Pytypespeed is a script to compute a user's average typing speed in words per minute. Using a prompt, the user will begin to retype the prompt, initializing a timer, and then, when done, the average words per minute will be reproduced along with error margin. 

TODO:
	Create prompt
	start timer when user begins reproducing said prompt
	calculate words per minute
	Get error margin in percent
	Save to file to make a "scoreboard"
	Have players login to see their different scores
